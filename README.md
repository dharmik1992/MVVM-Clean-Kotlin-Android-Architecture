# MVVM-Clean-Kotlin-Android-Architecture
A minimalistic Android application consuming a [TMDB Movie API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/) to display popular movie list. Built with Clean architecture and Jetpack component (Jetpack Compose, MVVM Clean, Kotlin, HILT, ROOM DB, Retrofit2, Coroutines, Kotlin Flow and many more..). It was made to describe the latest android development trend. This app will be updated further to adapt to latest development trend.

**App features:**

- List of latest popular movies
- Movie Detail Screen

## Architecture
Uses concepts of the Uncle Bob's architecture called [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).</br>

* Better separation of concerns. Each module has a clear API., Feature related classes life in different modules and can't be referenced without explicit module dependency.
* Features can be developed in parallel eg. by different teams
* Each feature can be developed in isolation, independently from other features
* faster compile time

This architecture design is mostly inspired by [Android-Clean-Architecture-Boilerplate](https://github.com/bufferapp/android-clean-architecture-boilerplate).

## Modules:
* **app** - It uses all the components and classes related to Android Framework. It gets the data from domain layer and shows on UI. (**access all the modules**)
* **domain** - The domain layer contains the UseCases that encapsulate a single and very specific task that can be performed. This task is part of the business logic of the application. (Kotlin module that **cannot access any other module**)
* **data** - The data layer implements the repository interface that the domain layer defines. This layer provide a single source of truth for data. (Kotlin module that **can only access domain module**)
* **remote** - Handles data interacting with the network. (**can only access data module**)
* **cache** - Handles data interacting with the local storing (Room DB). (**can only access data module**)
